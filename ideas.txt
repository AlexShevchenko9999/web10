create scoped mongo accts. with collection level priveliges, make rando passwords
// no good, because how do you charge?

Feasible cross web10 communication with malicious parties.
web10 record of charges
    - master record
    - charge dictionary (user,service,requester,period)
    - web10 server record
    - web10 user record
service whitelist configurable credit limits (requester,period)
    - by requester type [web10 user or ip]
    - regex kind of expression
web10 backend service for automatic whitelist blacklist management for anti spam
// definitely long sighted future thinking

refactor so there is 1 mongo collection per user, and all services inside of there.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/collection-level-access-control/
// could be more manageable.

double SDK reference with one being relative local path and one being url is good because :
- web10.app while dockering wont break
- dockering will run the relative path
- undockered code will run the deployed sdk
// counter intuitive triple advantage

make a CRM contacts updator in the modal
make CRM notes updator
// being able to update could be cute.

jacoby149/wildcard/service
special service that doesnt require an init! 
wildcard sets service terms without SMC
(purely based on your token)
[maybe token has a list of allowable wildcards]
// could be convenient to not always require user permission. [especially in extremely well trusted apps]

CRM Visual Ideas
web10 address as a field
phone links to calling on smartphone
concealed fields on mobile, [searchable] but on the modal you can see all the fields
hitting android enter key brings you to the next logical field in a loop
on mobile, drop the search bar below the Add button
hide the search bar if there is no one in the table
have a delete mode that deletes

Fix off by a few pixels height react
Fix mobile address bar wiggle

Address Per Record Privacy
CRM add per user wall
CRM add declining services
CRM deleting a contact deletes all of their stuff too.
Greenstar CRM address UI deletion safety

reserve 'anon' as a username for nonweb10 users
then you can add anon to the blacklist :)

document that only true values are read on whitelists and blacklists
document that "all" overrides

discourage the use of mongodb ids in docs, 
it could break the export and import\
Address import _ID issues

Change Password
Document auth portal / service editor.
add stripe recurring payments

revertable updates
#copy query over to * backup collection
username.service.aggregate([ { $match: {query} }, { $out: "username.*.service.updatebackups.exactTimeString" } ])
#do the update
username.service.update(query,update)
size(usernamecollection) - size(username.*) > cap ? //the user has gone over their limit
#copy collection back to the service
username.*.service.updatebackups.exactTimeString.aggregate([ { $match: {query} }, { $out: "username.service" } ])
on revertable updates, store the initial read somewhere safe. (maybe all mongo side, copy to (*) then copy back)
* doesn't have documents, it has subcollections for the copy operations
send all the revert update one queries to the db simultaneously in a list

HOW to prevent absolute update query abuse, 1TB worth of updates...
update_one :)

// for photos and multimedia
web10 gridFS file storage

todo handle importing...

dont allow updating star record, but also dont allow creation of a star record

mongo dies on alot of collections... how to fix!
Refactor so that all is in one collection

def diff_month(d1, d2):
    return (d1.year - d2.year) * 12 + d1.month - d2.month


collection collision on signup
why not take out username of the * field
email collection on signup can't change! (can't delete account either.)
* record banned field? :)

wapi [target,tieredtoken] dict
debug cross web10 requests

change username

meter reads and writes!!! and updates!! to exact file sizes

unsubscribe mode,
a list of subscribed services with a cancel subscription toggle
cancels the subscription at the next refreshable time
"if no one heard it was there a sound?"

a macros.py would indicate, what can the settings even be?
web10 app directory

/per app usage statistics


money transfer scheme should be able to facilitate an online poker demo
subscription requests [subscribe to endpoint]
user hits yes no on * service page
user can unsubscribe from things in unsubscribe mode
developer can check_subscribed:true on service whitelist
developer can use the check_subscribed function in their business logic servers
let developers cash out credits [paypal]

stripe customer id handle if stripe is down.
change username

/usage statistics hookup

possibly make web10 payments through tokens

possibly store payments in a transactions endpoint

possibly store subscription data in the * service.
have a desubscriber field in the settings
on reload of the star service, 

add web10.transactions [sender,reciever,service,date,amount,label]
add web10.subscriptions / deletion in service settings.
web10 payouts

sanitize find, create, and delete via. q_t sanitation

implement import
test & deploy

i want to only check for payments if it is necessary
    - looking at the * OR
    - out of credits
