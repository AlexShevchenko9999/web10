create scoped mongo accts. with collection level priveliges, make rando passwords
// no good, because how do you charge?

Feasible cross web10 communication with malicious parties.
web10 record of charges
    - master record
    - charge dictionary (user,service,requester,period)
    - web10 server record
    - web10 user record
service whitelist configurable credit limits (requester,period)
    - by requester type [web10 user or ip]
    - regex kind of expression
web10 backend service for automatic whitelist blacklist management for anti spam
// definitely long sighted future thinking

refactor so there is 1 mongo collection per user, and all services inside of there.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/collection-level-access-control/
// could be more manageable.

double SDK reference with one being relative local path and one being url is good because :
- web10.app while dockering wont break
- dockering will run the relative path
- undockered code will run the deployed sdk
// counter intuitive triple advantage

make a CRM contacts updator in the modal
make CRM notes updator
// being able to update could be cute.

// could be convenient to not always require user permission. [especially in extremely well trusted apps]
